Welcome!

### Projects.
#### [Project One.](https://github.com/joycetv29/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab01_joyce/s19magd150lab01_joyce.pde)
Project One was, you guessed it, the first project that we were assigned to work on in this class.

#### [Project Two.](https://github.com/joycetv29/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab02_joyce/s19magd150lab02_joyce.pde)
Project Two asked us to start playing with color and color modes, and to use more complicated shapes such as triagnles, quadrilaterals, and the like, all while keeping to the theme of "space".

#### [Project Three.](https://github.com/joycetv29/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/s19mag150lab03_joyce/s19mag150lab03_joyce.pde)
Project Three was quite the challenge, as it asked us to create functions that involved the use of the mouse and *lot* of math, which I may or may not have tried to get out of the way by incorporating a ridiculous amount of addition, subtratction, multiplication, and division in a few of the functions when I could have simply written, "50," instead. However, I think that it is one of the most enjoyable and interactive projects that I have made to date, even if it is rather simple.

#### [Project Four.](https://github.com/joycetv29/MAGD150/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab04_joyce/s19magd150lab04_joyce.pde)
Ah, the dreaded mouse and key functions -- eaily the most enjoyable to play with as a viewer, but exceedingly difficult for me to understand and write without wanting to tear my hair out. The only thing that confounds me more would be loops and if-else statements, which, as fate would have it, were also required to be a part of this particular code. In the end, though, I did find this particular project to be overall enjoyable, and I think that the resulting image (that of a pizza with pepperoni slices flying madly about when the keys or mouse are pressed) is somewhat amusing. 

#### [Project Ten.](https://github.com/joycetv29/MAGD150/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab10_joyce)
Looking back on it, Project Ten was probably one of the most difficult assignments to create. I had stopped being intimidated by 3D shapes earlier on -- it would have made this project far easier to deal with and saved a lot of time and struggle.
